# Frontend analytics

The goal of frontend analytics is to make better product decisions and build smarter features. The focus areas of strong analytics are:

- Getting data into the platform such as Apdex and Experiments,
- Have confidence in the quality of the analytics data,
- Provide seamless tooling with quality checking, sending, registering and debugging events.

## Events types

Events should be categorised into one of the following types: **Screen, UI, Track, and Operational**, depending on what it is that you are trying to capture. Some information is consistent across all of these events, but it is important to pay attention to where it is appropriate to use each type of event and the structure and naming conventions required for that event type.

### Screen

Screen events are analytics events that fire when a user navigates to a particular screen, tab, drawer, modal, or inline-dialog. They enable us to see what paths our users are taking to perform a specific task and provide insight into where they are dropping off.

Tabs, drawers, modals, and inline-dialogs are included in the definition as they often take over the screen and require user input. If we didn't include them we would be missing large parts of our navigation paths.

We use a formula to give each screen a unique name that is easy to understand. We do this to avoid capturing URLs that can potentially contain sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or User Generated Content (UGC) and change over time.

| Form    | Syntax                         | Example                                   |
|---------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Full    | User viewed screen<**screen**> | User viewed screen<**createIssueScreen**> |
| Regular | User viewed the <**screen**>   | User viewed the <**createIssueScreen**>   |
| Short   | viewed **screen**              | viewed **createIssueScreen**              |

### UI

UI events are analytics events that fire when a user interacts with a user interface element such as a button, text field, or link. They enable us to see how users are performing certain tasks.

#### Grammar

**Action** - what the user did

- **action** - a past tense verb describing the action, for the majority of UI events this will probably be "clicked"
- **actionSubject** - the element type involved in the action, e.g. "button"
- **actionSubjectId** - the unique instance of the element if required, e.g. "createIssueButton"

**Context** - where in the product

- **source** - the name of the screen the element was on, e.g. "viewIssueScreen"
- **object** - the objectType and objectId if the action was performed in an Object
- **container** - the containerType and containerId if the action was performed in a Container

#### Example

> User performed action<**action**>
> on actionSubject<**actionSubject, actionSubjectId**>
> from source<**source**>
> in object<**objectType, objectId**>
> and container<**containerType, containerId**>

translates to:

> User performed action<**clicked**>
> on actionSubject<**button, createCommentButton**>
> from source<**viewIssueScreen**>
> in object<**issue, 10**>
> and container<**project, 20**>

#### E-MAU (External Monthly Active Users)

While both E-MAU and the "ui viewed" event are related they aren't the same thing. E-MAU is defined as:

> The number of authenticated users, who have viewed the product, for at least 2 seconds, in the main chrome of an > Atlassian product, at least once in a trailing 28-day window

The "ui viewed" event implements this definition as close as possible and is used to calculate the eventual E-MAU number. However, for some product teams their E-MAU numbers will also consist of more than just the "ui viewed" event, e.g. Bitbucket's E-MAU is a combination of "ui viewed" and "repository pulled/pushed" Track events. The platform is designed to support adding additional events to a product's E-MAU definition if the need arises.

### Track

Track events are analytics events that fire when an actor successfully completes a product action such as creating a Jira issue or viewing a Confluence page. Note that Track events indicate an action has occurred, not the intention to take an action. For example, clicking on a comment box is a UI event, but once the comment has been saved and created, that is a track event.

They can be triggered by three different actor (users or bots). They're often fired for Objects, Containers, and Elements, however, this is not a requirement. For example, you could instrument a Track event to capture sending feedback in Jira, which doesn't fall into any of these categories.

In order for us to have accurate and actionable data we often have to fire duplicate events from both the client and server:

- Server-side (back end) Track events provide a way for us to capture interactions from all the actors so we can get an accurate total
  - For example, total issues created in Jira via Bulk imports, API requests, and front-end user actions
- Client-side (front end) Track events provide more contextual (source, platform, etc) information so we can get actionable data
  - For example, User A created an issue in Jira Service Desk from Customer Portal B. Here we capture important context that is not available on the backend.

#### Grammar

Same as UI

#### Example

> Actor performed action<**action**>
> on actionSubject<**actionSubject, actionSubjectId**>
> from source<**source**>
> in object<**objectType, objectId**>
> and container<**containerType, containerId**>

translates to:

> Actor performed action<**created**>
> on actionSubject<**comment, 30**>
> from source<**viewIssueScreen**>
> in object<**issue, 10**>
> and container<**project, 222**>

#### Client vs. Server Events

Client events must contain full context whenever they are instrumented. Server events exist because we need to know what % of total actions are captured by the client events. Where possible, server events should still contain context. E.g. the "issue created (server)" event might contain "API" or "email" as the source.

#### Identifying service-side events

Analytics events need a user identifier in order for them to show up in Amplitude, in most cases the **userIdType** and **userId** fields are available on the server-side however there are some rare cases where this information will be lost or not available, in these situations you should populate the **anonymousId** field with a randomly generated UUID. Here are some general guidelines you should observe when doing this:

- do not share **anonymousIds** between events unless you know they are the same user (Amplitude will merge all users with the same anonymousId making your data inaccurate)

#### Origin, platform and source

The origin, platform, and source fields are less straight forward on the server-side as they can be triggered by different actors with context not always being available. However, by populating these fields consistently we can perform powerful aggregation queries and answer questions like - Where are our users creating issues from? Are they trending more towards a new Connect add-on?

With these fields what we're trying to capture is **where the action was performed not what ultimately fired the analytics event**, in a lot of cases we will have to fallback to the "unknown" value, however this is better than having inaccurate data.

##### Users

- origin = The platform family of the product the user was using when they performed the action (web, desktop, mobile, api, console),
- platform = The platform of the product the user was using when they performed the action.
For API and console this is not required (web, ios, android, mac, windows, linux),
- source = The screen the user was on when they performed the action (viewIssueScreen, createIssueModal, etc.)

##### Systems

- origin = Only use internal (internal),
- platform = Not required,
- source = The name of the process or system performing the action (emailProcess, graphQLGateway, etc.)

##### Plug-ins

- origin = Only use api (api),
- platform = Type of plugin (connect, bot),
- source = The Connect add-on or bot that performed the action, this is usually the issuer in the JWT token (com.example.some.addon)

### Operational

Operational events are analytics events that are used to help measure usages or performance of implementation detail. These events are not used to measure user actions, but rather help identify your feature is functioning correctly.

For example an operational event can fire when a user triggers an internal UI component event such as its initialisation. This would enable you to see the performance and usage frequency of the UI component and help determine if you should optimise its loading patterns (e.g. lazy loading).

Another example is if you had a background task running which does not necessarily have user interaction but performed by the system. Firing an event every time this task is run would enable you to have visibility over its usage and performance. i.e Automation rules in Jira Service Desk.

StatsD/SignalFx may be a better route if you want visibility over performance degradation and need to react quickly to something failing.

Operational events are better if you need to add rich attributes and wish to analyse metrics using SQL.

#### Grammar

Same as UI

#### Example

> User performed action<**action**>
> on actionSubject<**actionSubject, actionSubjectId**>
> from source<**source**>
> in object<**objectType, objectId**>
> and container<**containerType, containerId**>

translates to:

> User performed action<**initialised**>
> on actionSubject<**editor, commentEditor**>
> from source<**viewIssueScreen**>
> in object<**issue, 10**>
> and container<**project, 20**>
