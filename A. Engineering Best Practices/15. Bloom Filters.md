# Bloom Filter

Use a Bloom filters to quickly find if an element might be present in a set.

The Bloom filter data structure tells whether an element may be in a set, or definitely is not. The only possible errors are false positives, i.e., a search for a nonexistent element might give an incorrect answer. With more elements in the filter, the error rate increases. An empty Bloom filter is a bit-array of m bits, all set to 0. There are also k different hash functions, each of which maps a set element to one of the m bit positions.

- To add an element, feed it to the hash functions to get k bit positions, and set the bits at these positions to 1.

- To test if an element is in the set, feed it to the hash functions to get k bit positions.
  - If any of the bits at these positions is 0, the element is definitely not in the set.
  - If all are 1, then the element may be in the set.

Here is a Bloom filter with three elements `P`, `Q`, and `R`. It consists of 20 bits and uses three hash functions. The colored arrows point to the bits that the elements of the set are mapped to:

- The element `X` definitely is not in the set, since it hashes to a bit position containing 0.

- For a fixed error rate, adding a new element and testing for membership are both constant time operations, and a filter with room for n elements requires `O(n)O(n)` space.
