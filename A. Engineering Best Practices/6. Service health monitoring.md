# Service health monitoring

The platform validates the health of your service via healthchecks and deepchecks at deployment time, and continuously after deployment via continued polling of healthchecks.

## Platform-assisted mechanisms

### Healthcheck (aka _heartbeat_)

<table>
  <th>
   <td colspan="2">Healthcheck (aka heartbeat)</td>
  </th>
  <tr>
    <td>Intent & Overview</td>
    <td>
    - Validates that a node can process requests, excluding dependencies on backing resources or services. A failure implies the node should stop processing requests; it will be automatically replaced. Invoked on deployment (before a new stack starts receiving traffic) and ongoing by AWS infrastructure.

    - Registered as the AWS Autoscaling Group Healthcheck resource.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Checked on upgrade before DNS switch?</td>
    <td>
    Yes, called once on deployment of a new version before flipping over the DNS record.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Ongoing checks after deployment?</td>
    <td>
    Yes, each node is polled every 15 seconds by the Auto Scaling Group.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Default URL</td>
   <td>/healthcheck</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Do:</td>
   <td>
   - Let a request run through your application stack, without hitting external dependencies.
   - Issue helpful log data, especially on failure.
   </td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
   <td>Do not:</td>
   <td>
   - Check external dependencies. If you do this, you risk overloading the external dependencies (since the healthcheck is hit very frequently), and will unnecessarily prompt your services' nodes to be restarted when external dependencies fail.
   - Execute long-running or resource intensive checks. The default timeout for the healthcheck is 5 seconds.
   </td>
  </tr>
  </tr>
   <tr>
   <td>Service-level or node-level check?</td>
   <td>
  Both node and service level:
  - Node-level: The ELB regularly hits the healthcheck URL on every single node every 15 seconds to determine whether to send traffic to the node (nodes failing healthchecks are terminated by the Auto Scaling group).
  - Service-level: External services' healthchecks are registered with Pingdom, and are exercised via the ELB once per minute.
   </td>
  </tr>
  </tr>
   <tr>
   <td>Behaviour on failure?</td>
   <td>
   - During deployment: Deployment of failing version is blocked
   - During ongoing monitoring: Node is automatically recycled after 5 consecutive failures
   - If the number of healthy nodes remains below the minimum requested despite restarts, an alert will be fired.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Which metrics?</td>
   <td>
   - CloudWatch metrics: `aws.elb.healthy_host_count`
   - Pollinator metrics (if set up): `pollinator.check.*`
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Deepcheck

<table>
  <th>
   <td colspan="2">Deepcheck</td>
  </th>
  <tr>
    <td>Intent & Overview</td>
    <td>
    - Validates that a service can process requests and access its direct backing resources. Invoked on deployment (before a new stack starts receiving traffic).

    - Polled on a regular basis via Pollinator, and (optional) alert on failure.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Checked on upgrade before DNS switch?</td>
    <td>
    Yes, called once on deployment of a new version before flipping over the DNS record.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Ongoing checks after deployment?</td>
    <td>
    Yes, polled every minute via Pollinator, and (optional) alert on failure.

   Pollinator checks can be manually edited via Pollinator itself. As long as the name and tags remain the same, Micros won't overwrite changes made to them (for things like alerts or the check interval).
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Default URL</td>
   <td>None. Opt-in with a mandatory URL, suggested path is /deepcheck</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Do:</td>
   <td>
   - Check access to direct dependencies, e.g. database connections, HTTP access to dependent services with auth...
   - Run a very basic, light weight synthetic test, e.g. reading a resource, storing a resource and reading it again (to check backwards compatibility, and basic read/write).
   - Keep in mind this operation will eventually be run regularly (e.g. every minute).
   - Issue helpful log data, especially on failure
   - Issue metrics (via statsd), e.g. latency accessing external resources etc...
   </td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
   <td>Do not:</td>
   <td>
   - Hit other services' deepchecks.
   - Take longer than your configured ELB timeout (default 60 seconds) to execute.
   </td>
  </tr>
  </tr>
   <tr>
   <td>Service-level or node-level check?</td>
   <td>
  Service-level only: Called via the ELB only, meaning only 1 node is hit regardless of how many nodes are running in the service's autoscaling group.
   </td>
  </tr>
  </tr>
   <tr>
   <td>Behaviour on failure?</td>
   <td>
   - During deployment: Deployment of failing version is blocked.
   - In emergencies - i.e. when some dependant resources is expected to be down - this can be bypassed by using --ignoreDeepCheck on deploy.
   - During ongoing monitoring: Polling is performed by Pollinator which will trigger Pagerduty alerts on repeated failures.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Which metrics?</td>
   <td>
   - Pollinator metrics (if set up): `pollinator.check.*`
   </td>
  </tr>

### Pollinator checks

<table>
  <th>
   <td colspan="2">Pollinator run-once synthetic checks</td>
  </th>
  <tr>
    <td>Intent & Overview</td>
    <td>
   - Validates that a service can successfully perform its primary function, via Pollinator Run Once functionality. Invoked on deployment (before a new stack starts receiving traffic).

   - Not polled on a regular basis (although ongoing polling using the same check definitions may be configured via Pollinator's web UI).
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Checked on upgrade before DNS switch?</td>
    <td>
    Yes, called once on deployment of a new version before flipping over the DNS record.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Ongoing checks after deployment?</td>
    <td>
    Not via Micros Integration. Micros will not automatically configure these checks to run on a continuous basis; this may be configured manually via Pollinator.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Default URL</td>
   <td>None. Opt-in with a mandatory URL, suggested path is /deepcheck</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Do:</td>
   <td>
   - Exercise the most critical scenarios the service provides
   - Run lightweight synthetic tests
   - Create several small, lightweight checks rather than one check that performs many tasks
   - Tests should be idempotent, setup/clean up their data, and be able to run multiple times
   - Issue helpful log data, especially on failure
   </td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
   <td>Do not:</td>
   <td>
   - Write long, slow tests (the timeout for synthetic checks is 2 minutes)
   - Run lots of tests (these are not a replacement for integration tests!)
   </td>
  </tr>
  </tr>
   <tr>
   <td>Service-level or node-level check?</td>
   <td>
   Service-level only: Called via Pollinator, which can only access the service via ELB, meaning 1 node is hit regardless of how many nodes are running.
   </td>
  </tr>
  </tr>
   <tr>
   <td>Behaviour on failure?</td>
   <td>
   During deployment, if any specified Run Once check fails, it will block deployment of that version of the service. This can be bypassed  using --ignoreRunOnceChecks on deploy.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Which metrics?</td>
   <td>
   - Pollinator check results
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>
