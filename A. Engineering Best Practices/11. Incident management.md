# Incident management

## Introduction

Let's formalise what qualifies an incident:

"An existing or inpending intentional negative impact on Confidentiality, Integrity or Availability of either Customer Data, Company Data or Company Services."

> Why dealing with incidents using a standardised manner?

To reduce the time to recovery (TTR) of incidents via standardising and scaling our response to them.

## Incident Process

- File an HOT ticket:
  - can be done manyally or automatically,
  - there shall be an associated conference room
- Determine if incident is major or minor:
  - if minor, shall be handled directly and PIR isn't mandatory
  - if major, **wait** that an Incident Manager (IM) acknowledges it (usually within 15 min)
  - if major, a PIR ticket must be created upon completion
- Diagnose incident severity:
  - SEV0 to SEV2 are major incidents:  
    - SEV0 is crisis
    - SEV1 is critical
    - SEV2 is important
    - consider HOT ticket's severity as "peak" severity:
      - peak severity shouldn't be downgraded once impact has been mitigated,
      - however can be handled as lower severity afterwards
  - SEV3 is for all minor incidents
  - check severity matrix and study:
    - total service outage
    - is service degraded?
    - are there data loss?
    - how many customers are affected?
    - how many support tickets are raised?
- Incident can be resolved once business impact has been mitigated (discuss creation of a PIR)
- Note: cleanup outside impact window isn't part of the incident

## On-Call Process

- Person being paged is the "First Responder":
  - closes the Page and comes online within 15 minutes
  - determines if page is an incident
  - determines severity:
    - if minor, can be handled immediately or during business hours
  - creates the incident
  - collaborates with the Incident Manager in case of a major incident
- note: the Incident Manage can page subsequent teams called "Escalation Responders"

## Communication channels

| Channel                         | Notes                                                                                |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| HOT Ticket                      | Mandatory, source of truth for state and severity                                    |
| Slack Channel                   | Recommended for realtime detailed comms                                              |
| Zoom War Room                   | May be required for quick attendance                                                 |
| Physical War Room               | May be required for major incidents                                                  |
| Incident State Document (ISD)   | Utilised in laterally affecting incidents to keep on top of multiple streams of work |
| Internal Statuspage             | Mandatory for major incidents, mainly internal and 3rd party systems                 |
| Internal Management Team Comms  | Mandatory for major incidents                                                        |
| External Comms, Support Tickets | Recommended                                                                          |
| External Statuspage             | Recommended                                                                          |
| External Comms, Legal/Marketing | For public communications and/or bulk emails to affected customers                   |

## Post Incident Review (PIR)

This process can be run by a PIR owner to:

- mitigate the reoccurence of an incident
- extract some learnings from an incident
- "are we doing enough for our customers?"

> Which differences between a PIR and PIR-X (express) ?

| PIR               | PIR-X (express)             |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| For SEV0 and SEV1 | For SEV2 and SEV3           |
| requires meeting  | simpler and more autonomous |
| needs training    | no need for training        |

> What kind of outcome?

| Priority actions                 | Improvement actions                    |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Tactical/short-term actions      | Strategic/long-term actions            |
| Mitigate reoccurence of incident | could be unrelated/system improvements |
| low/medium/high priorities       |                                        |
| risk cost matrix                 |                                        |
| ex: _raise service capacity_     | ex: _implement rate limiting_          |
