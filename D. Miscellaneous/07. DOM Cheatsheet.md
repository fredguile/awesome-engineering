# DOM Cheatsheet

## Elements width/height

The CSS box model is rather complicated, particularly when it comes to scrolling content. While the browser uses the values from your CSS to draw boxes, determining all the dimensions using JS is not straight-forward if you only have the CSS.

That's why each element has six DOM properties for your convenience: `offsetWidth`, `offsetHeight`, `clientWidth`, `clientHeight`, `scrollWidth` and `scrollHeight`. These are read-only attributes representing the current visual layout, and all of them are integers (thus possibly subject to rounding errors).

Let's go through them in detail:

- `offsetWidth`, `offsetHeight`: The size of the visual box incuding all borders. Can be calculated by adding width/height and paddings and borders, if the element has `display: block`.
- `clientWidth`, `clientHeight`: The visual portion of the box content, not including borders or scroll bars, but includes padding. Can not be calculated directly from CSS, depends on the system's scroll bar size.
- `scrollWidth`, `scrollHeight`: The size of all of the box's content, including the parts that are currently hidden outside the scrolling area. Can not be calculated directly from CSS, depends on the content.

## How much room does it use up?

If you need to know the total amount of space an element occupies, including the width of the visible content, scrollbars (if any), padding, and border, you want to use the `HTMLElement.offsetWidth` and `HTMLElement.offsetHeight` properties. Most of the time these are the same as width and height of `Element.getBoundingClientRect()`, when there aren't any transforms applied to the element. In case of transforms, the `offsetWidth` and `offsetHeight` returns the element's layout width and height, while `getBoundingClientRect()` returns the rendering width and height. As an example, if the element has `width: 100px;` and `transform: scale(0.5);` the `getBoundingClientRect()` will return 50 as the width, while `offsetWidth` will return 100.

## What's the size of the displayed content?

If you need to know how much space the actual displayed content takes up, including padding but not including the border, margins, or scrollbars, you want to use the `Element.clientWidth` and `Element.clientHeight` properties:

## How big is the content?

If you need to know the actual size of the content, regardless of how much of it is currently visible, you need to use the `Element.scrollWidth` and `Element.scrollHeight` properties. These return the width and height of the entire content of an element, even if only part of it is presently visible due to the use of scroll bars.

For example, if a 600x400 pixel element is being displayed inside a 300x300 pixel scrollbox, `scrollWidth` will return 600 while `scrollHeight` will return 400.

## What with images?

`clientWidth` represents the width of the element and is subject to manipulation by the browser. For example, a 300px wide image can be resized and this manipulated value will come through in `clientWidth`.

`naturalWidth` is the natural width of the element. In the example of a 300px wide image, the `naturalWidth` will still be 300 even if the image is resized in the browser via CSS or JavaScript.
